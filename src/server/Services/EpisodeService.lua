-- Owns interactive episodes: hands them out, validates client input and sends back results.
-- The client only ever sends its input; it never reports an outcome.
--
-- Training flow, decided here so the client can't skip it:
--   stage SHOT  TUTORIAL (one guided shot that always scores) -> TASK (score Training.TaskGoals)
--   stage PASS  TUTORIAL (one guided pass that always arrives) -> TASK (PassConfig.Training.TaskPasses good passes)
--   After a TASK the phase is DONE and the menu asks for "RETRY" (task again) or "NEXT" (next stage).
--   A good pass is followed by a SHOT episode (mode FOLLOWUP) from where the receiver took the ball;
--   the pass already counted, the shot only adds to `bonusGoals`. The pass's status (TUTORIAL_DONE,
--   CONTINUE, COMPLETED) is reported with the shot's result.
--   stage FREE  free shooting against the normal keeper (placeholder until a full match exists)
-- Misses never reset task progress.
--
-- Input per episode kind (SubmitEpisodeInput):
--   SHOT  (episodeId, aimX -1..1, aimY 0..1, power 0..1)
--   PASS  (episodeId, dirX -1..1, dirZ -1..1, power 0..1, clientTime) - clientTime: seconds since
--         the client showed the episode; sets where the patrolling defender was, within MaxLag.
